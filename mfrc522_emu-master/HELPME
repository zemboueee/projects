# Register map

MFRC522_CMDREG              0x01
    starts and stops command execution

    MFRC522_CMDREG_CMD          0x0F
        activates a command based on the Command value
        reading this register shows which command is executed

    MFRC522_CMDREG_SOFTPWRDOWN  0x10
        Soft power-down mode entered

    MFRC522_CMDREG_RCVOFF       0x20
        analog part of the receiver is switched off


MFRC522_FIFODATAREG         0x09
    input and output of 64 byte FIFO buffer


MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG        0x0A
    number of bytes stored in the FIFO buffer

    MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG_LEVEL  0x7F
        indicates the number of bytes stored in the FIFO buffer
        writing to the FIFODataReg register increments and reading decrements
        the FIFOLevel value

    MFRC522_FIFOLEVELREG_FLUSH  0x80
        immediately clears the internal FIFO buffer’s read and write pointer and
        ErrorReg register’s BufferOvfl bit
        reading this bit always returns 0

# Command set
MFRC522_IDLE                0x0
    no action, cancels current command execution

MFRC522_MEM                 0x1
    stores 25 bytes into the internal buffer

MFRC522_GENERATERANDOMID    0x2
    generates a 10-byte random ID number

MFRC522_NOCMDCHANGE         0x7
    no command change, can be used to modify the CommandReg register bits
    without affecting the command, for example, the PowerDown bit

MFRC522_SOFTRESET           0xF
    resets the MFRC522


To read out data from a specific register address in the MFRC522,
the host controller must use the following procedure:

•Firstly, a write access to the specific register address must be performed as indicated in the frame that follows
•The first byte of a frame indicates the device address according to the I2C-bus rules
•The second byte indicates the register address. No data bytes are added
•The Read/Write bit is 0

After the write access, read access can start. The host sends the device address of the MFRC522.
In response, the MFRC522 sends the content of the read access register.
In one frame all data bytes can be read from the same register address.
This enables fast FIFO buffer access or register polling.The Read/Write (R/W) bit is set to logic 1
